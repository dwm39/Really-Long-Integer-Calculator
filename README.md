# Really Long Number Calculator

## OVERVIEW

The ArrayDS code implements 2 interfaces called SequenceInterface<T>` and `ReorderInterface. The codes underlying data structure is a 2d array of BagInterface<T> which will store the positions of each element of the sequence based on the inputted alphabet. This data structure allows for the compact storage of long sequences in order to do certain operations. ArrayDS can do mutiple things to the sequences such as add, remove, reverse, rotate left, rotate right, and more. The ReallyLongInt class is responsible for comparing, adding, and subrtracting these long number sequnces.
